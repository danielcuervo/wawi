# package jwk

`package jwk` provides a simple implementation of JWK, as described in the [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517)

A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key. 

This specification also defines a JWK Set JSON data structure that represents a set of JWKs.

This implementation currently supports public keys only.
